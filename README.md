# Drowsiness_Detection
•	Drowsy Driver Detection System has been developed using a non-intrusive machine vision based concepts. The system uses a small monochrome security camera that points directly towards the driver’s face and monitors the driver’s eyes in order to detect fatigue. In such a case when fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver.  
•	In this system, the eye blink of the driver is detected by using OPENcv with python.
